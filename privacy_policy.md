## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how your data is handled when using my app. I am committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about my practices.

### Bluetooth Access
The app requires Bluetooth permission to connect to compatible hardware devices. This connection is used solely for device communication and no Bluetooth-related data is collected or stored beyond the current session.

## Data Storage

- All app data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No analytics or usage data is collected
- No crash reports are collected
- No third-party services are used

## Changes to Data

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can clear the app's data through your device's settings at any time.

## Children's Privacy

My app does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Third-Party Services

I do not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.
